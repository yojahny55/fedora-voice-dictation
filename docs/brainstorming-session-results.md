**P - Put to Other Use:**
7. Learning tool: Practice pronunciation/languages with transcription feedback
8. Voice macros: Trigger scripts/commands for repetitive tasks

**E - Eliminate:**
9. Eliminate cloud features entirely: No accounts, no sync, 100% local
10. Eliminate multi-user support: Single-user only for simplicity

**R - Reverse/Rearrange:**
11. No reversals needed

#### Insights Discovered:
- Combining features (VAD+hotkey, history+snippets) creates emergent value
- IDE paradigms transfer well to voice interaction
- Strategic elimination reduces complexity without losing value
- Voice macros extend utility beyond pure dictation

### Insights & Learnings
*Key realizations from the session*

- **Speed vs. Accuracy trade-off**: For LLM prompting workflow, fast "good enough" transcription beats slow perfect transcription. Users can iterate on prompts rather than perfecting initial dictation.

- **Local-first architecture advantages**: 100% offline, no cloud, single-user design = simplicity + privacy + reliability. Eliminates entire categories of complexity (auth, sync, multi-tenancy).

- **Power user focus as design constraint**: Targeting developers/terminal users rather than general consumers informs every decision. Keyboard-first, config files, no hand-holding.

- **Hardware advantage unlocks capabilities**: RTX 4060 + 32GB RAM enables features impossible on typical hardware (large models, instant processing, model persistence). Design for the hardware you have, not average hardware.

- **Unified simplicity over mode complexity**: Same vocabulary across all contexts is better than complex mode-switching. Reduces cognitive load and learning curve.

- **Wayland as opportunity, not obstacle**: Modern protocols (text-input-unstable-v3, wlr-layer-shell) enable better integration than X11 hacks. Wayland-native design is future-proof.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Core Dictation Engine
- **Rationale:** Foundation for everything else. Nothing works without the basic transcription pipeline functioning reliably.
- **Next steps:**
  1. Set up Python environment with Whisper dependencies
  2. Implement audio capture using sounddevice library
  3. Integrate Whisper for real-time transcription
  4. Implement VAD (webrtcvad or silero-vad)
  5. Create basic pipeline: audio â†’ VAD â†’ Whisper â†’ text output
  6. Test with base model for speed/accuracy baseline
- **Resources needed:** Python 3.8+, openai-whisper, sounddevice, VAD library, PyAudio dependencies (portaudio)
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for basic working prototype

#### #2 Priority: Wayland Text Integration
- **Rationale:** Makes dictation actually useful in applications. Proves the concept works on Wayland without X11 fallbacks.
- **Next steps:**
  1. Research text-input-unstable-v3 protocol implementation in Python
  2. Implement text injection using Wayland protocols
  3. Create clipboard fallback mechanism
  4. Test on GNOME and Hyprland environments
  5. Handle edge cases (permissions, focus detection)
  6. Ensure reliable insertion across apps (terminal, VS Code, Claude Code)
- **Resources needed:** python-wayland bindings or pywlroots, Wayland protocol docs, test environments (GNOME, Hyprland), clipboard libraries, D-Bus Python bindings
- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (protocol complexity varies)

#### #3 Priority: GPU Acceleration & Speed Optimization
- **Rationale:** Speed is the #1 requirement. Without GPU acceleration, can't meet the "instant transcription" goal that makes this viable for LLM workflow.
- **Next steps:**
  1. Install CUDA toolkit for RTX 4060
  2. Explore whisper.cpp with CUDA vs. PyTorch CUDA
  3. Benchmark different models (tiny/base/small/medium) with GPU
  4. Implement streaming word-by-word output
  5. Optimize audio buffer sizes for minimal latency
  6. Profile and identify bottlenecks
  7. Test end-to-end latency with real usage
- **Resources needed:** NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, whisper.cpp or PyTorch with CUDA, profiling tools (cProfile, line_profiler), benchmarking scripts
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for optimization

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- Mind mapping provided comprehensive structural overview of all components
- SCAMPER revealed creative combinations (VAD+hotkey, history+snippets)
- What If scenarios validated hardware-specific optimizations
- Clear categorization separated MVP from future enhancements
- User's clarity on priorities and constraints accelerated decision-making

### Areas for Further Exploration
- **Text injection methods:** Deep dive into text-input-unstable-v3 vs. other Wayland protocols vs. clipboard strategies. May need experimentation to find most reliable approach.
- **VAD library selection:** Compare webrtcvad vs. silero-vad vs. others for accuracy and latency. Critical for user experience.
- **whisper.cpp vs. PyTorch:** Performance benchmarking needed to determine best GPU acceleration approach for RTX 4060.
- **Command grammar design:** Define vocabulary for command dictation, code snippets, editing commands. Needs structured design session.
- **LLM prompt optimization rules:** Specify exactly what transformations to apply in Claude Code mode (which filler words, what formatting).

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **Morphological Analysis:** For command vocabulary design - systematically explore combinations of verbs, objects, modifiers for voice commands.
- **Forced Relationships:** Connect voice dictation with other dev tools (git, debuggers, build tools) to discover integration opportunities.
- **Five Whys:** Deep dive into "why speed matters" to ensure architecture optimizes the right things.

### Questions That Emerged
- How to handle ambiguous commands (e.g., "delete line" - which line)?
- Should snippet suggestions be proactive (popup) or passive (available on request)?
- What's the minimum viable feature set that makes this immediately useful?
- How to balance model size (accuracy) vs. speed given GPU capabilities?
- Should there be a "training mode" for personal dictionary, or automatic learning?
- How to package/distribute on Fedora (RPM, Flatpak, pip)?

### Next Session Planning
- **Suggested topics:**
  - Technical architecture deep dive (component design, data flow)
  - Command vocabulary design (comprehensive grammar for all voice commands)
  - UI/UX mockups and interaction patterns
  - Testing strategy for Wayland integration
- **Recommended timeframe:** 1-2 weeks (after initial prototyping of Priority #1)
- **Preparation needed:**
  - Basic prototype working (even if text just goes to console)
  - Research results on Wayland protocols
  - Hardware benchmarks (Whisper model performance on RTX 4060)
